   <dcterms:description>Philadelphia; Coolie Verner has proposed that this map is most likely "the first separate map of Virginia to be drawn, printed, and published in America." Most earlier maps had been engraved and published in Europe where the best craftsman plied their trade. Aitken's map, however, was described by Verner as a crude engraving, having little significance. Aitken was born in Scotland and emigrated to Philadelphia in 1769 where he became a printer in 1774 and began publishing The Pennsylvania Magazine from January 1775 through 1776. Drawn by Pierre Eugene du Simitere, who came to the colonies from Switzerland in 1765, the map was published in The Pennsylvania Magazine I (1776), opposite page 184. The map is based on the Fry-Jefferson map of Virginia and includes the area from St. Mary's, Maryland to the area around Suffolk. Towns and residences are shown as well as some roads, and the forts in York and Gloucester. --From This New Founde Lande: The Henry &amp; Kaye Spalding Map Collection at Hampden-Sydney College, 2008.</dcterms:description>
